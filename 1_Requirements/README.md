# Quiz game system

A quiz is a mind sport where players try to test their knowledge and answer variety of questions on a variety of subjects. So it is kind of assessing yourself in all fields to measure your growth in knowledge, abilities and skills. So I have made a simple application in C language to test one's knowledge about C language basics. These kind of systems are helpful when one wants to test himself based on his learning and know ehere he stands and what he lacks at. Also in educational field, such kind of quiz systems can be useful to avoid tedious manual work especially given the present situation of online teaching.
